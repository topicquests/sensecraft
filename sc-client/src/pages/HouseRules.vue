    <h2>House Rules</h2>
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      Sensecraft promotes an ecosystem of <b>Trust</b> and <b>Safety</b> and
      <b>Civil conversation</b>. To support that, disrespectful behavior,
      including but not limited to threats, slander, libel, insults and
      <i>ad hominem</i> attacks will be deemed unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are simple rules, a minimalist set. We expect to improve on them by
      way of public Quests to gain deeper insight into the nature of game
      governance.
